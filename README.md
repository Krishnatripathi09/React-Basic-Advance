![React Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg)  

Welcome to my **React Learning Repository**! This project is my journey of learning React from scratch, starting with the basics and gradually exploring advanced concepts.  

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview  

This repository is a hands-on practice space where I:  
1. Build React applications from the ground up, starting with `npm init`.  
2. Used **Parcel** as a lightweight bundler to manage dependencies and bundle files efficiently.  
3. Learn the core concepts of React like components, state, props, and hooks.  
4. Gradually implement best practices for scalable React applications.
